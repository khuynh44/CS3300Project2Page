    <h3>Introduction/background</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this project is to allow users to play 24. Traditionally
      played with playing cards, 24 is a game where the player(s) are given four
      natural numbers, and must use ordinary math operations (addition,
      subtraction, multiplication, division) in order to make the number 24. The
      user will be given four numbers, and will attempt to make 24. When they
      are finished, then they will be given another set of four numbers, and
      they must, once again, make 24. They will do this as many times as they
      can within a given time frame. The user will then get a score based on how
      many they got correct; their high score will be stored with their account,
      and they will be able to see a leaderboard with each users high score
      ranked.
    </p>
    <h3>Motivation, Project Scope, Project Management</h3>
    <p>
      Due to time constraints, our team decided to focus on two game modes that 
      we believe to be the most enjoyable for the user. Future work that we would
       like to do would involve developing new game modes or even embedding this 
       game into a larger collection of similar obscure math/puzzle games.
    </p>
    <p>
      We utilized GroupMe for team communications and facilitated team meetings 
      via Zoom video conferences. We initially intended on using a ZenHub board 
      for project management, but this proved to be unnecessary and was instead 
      replaced with a simple living word document with week-to-week goals.
    </p>
    <h3>Literature Review</h3>
    <p>
      We used some websites as a basis for writing the code. For example: <a href="https://www.4nums.com/">https://www.4nums.com/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The UI for this game served as the inspiration for the type of UI we wanted to have for our game. In order to properly generate all possible combinations with a valid solution, we looked at ways of generating all combinations with repetition recursively: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/combinations-with-repetitions/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/combinations-with-repetitions/</a>, as well as all permutations recursively: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-to-print-all-permutations-of-a-given-string/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-to-print-all-permutations-of-a-given-string/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      These resources were incredibly useful to us when trying to find all possible combinations with solutions.
    </p>
    <h3>Software Technologies</h3>
    <p>
      Development of the frontend product will be completed in VS code, using
      vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS as well as an open-source code
      algorithm. Backend development will use Java and be completed in IntelliJ.
      The project will be hosted using Google App Engine, and user data will be
      stored using Google Cloud SQL. Version control for our project will be
      done in GitHub, integrating smoothly with our choice of IDE’s. Project
      management and task tracking will utilize the ZenHub extension, and
      comprehensive testing for the project and its functions will be written
      alongside the code using JUnit tests.
    </p>
    <h3>Project Lifecycle</h3>
    <p>
      Our team used an Agile software development strategy that was divided into 
      4 sprints. The sprint goals were Ideation & Requirements Analysis; 
      Repository Creation, Algorithm Development, & Initial Implementation; 
      Frontend & Backend Implementation; and Alpha Testing, Beta Testing, & Unit 
      Testing, respectively. Each sprint was one week long and concluded with a 
      team meeting to discuss any challenges, new directions, requirements changes, 
      and the work that we wanted to focus on in the following sprint. The meetings 
      were led by our project manager, Chris, and each teammate was expected to 
      give a progress report and discuss any blockers. We maintained two different 
      GitHub repositories for the project, one for the frontend and one for the 
      backend. These two components were deployed as independent Google Cloud 
      applications connected to each other via API calls.
    </p>
    <h3>Requirements (Functional and Non-Functional)</h3>
    <p>
      Our primary functional requirement was for our users to be able to play the
      game 24. This encompasses several functional requirements, including a user's
      ability to log in to the web app, interact with the game and submit an answer,
      recieve a response as to whether they were correct, and view their previous
      highscore. From a system perspective, this also includes the product's ability
      to log a user in and out and store and retrieve each user's highscore individually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our product's non functional requirements include the system's ability to change pages quickly on the average network, responsiveness to inputs and immediate feedback, and easy maintenance through a simplified codebase. Due to the minimal number of communications between frontend and backend, the site can support a significant number of users simultaneously, resulting in good scalability. Additionally, user's passwords are encrypted such that if an attacker gains access to our database, they will not be able to pull user's passwords.
    </p>
    <h3>Design - Architecture and low-level level diagrams</h3>
    <p>
      Our application is event driven. Below is a component diagram that describes 
      our (descriptive) architecture:
    </p>
    <img src="images/3300Componenetdiagram.png" alt="" width="600">
    <img src="images/sequencediagram.png" alt="" width="600">
    <p>
      As is shown, the data management, login, and account creation rely on the backend connections to the database and rest libraries, while any functionality related to the game itself, such as selecting problems and detecting whether a user has successfully completed it, is done by the frontend page.
    </p>
    <h3>Testing - Test Strategy, test cases and outcomes</h3>
    <p>
      Our testing consisted of a blackbox portion that involved alpha and beta testing as well as a whitebox portion that involved unit tests. Alpha testing was performed by each team member and beta testing was performed by a friend of each team member after we fixed bugs that were found during the alpha testing. There was a checklist that we made to evaluate the system:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create user</li>
      <li>Login as user</li>
      <li>Read “How to Play”</li>
      <li>Play timed run</li>
      <li>Play blitz round</li>
      <li>Check leaderboard</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Beta testing revealed that the users believed that the application met the minimum requirements of each list item, but that the UX was not ideal for a game that requires the user to play against a time limit. Future work will include improving the user interface to make it easier to use quickly. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The whitebox testing consisted of 15 unit tests that were performed using a Python script. The test cases provide ~87% statement coverage and are outlined below:

    <h3>UI</h3>
    <p>
      Our primary goal for the UI was to compartmentalize different functions into separate html files to promote easier changes and maintenance, and a more streamlined user flow that takes advantage of existing browser features. We have included below several images of the different pages in our product.
